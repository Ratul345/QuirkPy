# Contributing to QuirkPy 🌀

Welcome to the chaos! This guide will help you contribute to the most unpredictable Python project on GitHub.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Fork the repo** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/QuirkPy.git
   cd QuirkPy
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your chaos:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-awesome-chaos
   ```

## 🎯 What Can You Add?

The sky's the limit! Here are some ideas to get your creativity flowing:

### 🎨 Creative Greetings (NO basic print statements!)
- **Language greetings**: Add "Hello World" in different languages WITH cultural context
- **ASCII art**: Create beautiful text-based art (minimum 5 lines)
- **Emoji combinations**: Creative emoji stories, not just random emojis
- **Cultural references**: Greetings from different cultures with explanations
- **Interactive greetings**: Functions that respond to user input or system info

### 🤖 Technical Features (Must add value!)
- **Random generators**: Weather, jokes, quotes with context and sources
- **Time-based greetings**: Different messages for morning/night with logic
- **File-based greetings**: Load from creative text files you create
- **API integrations**: Weather, news, or social media with error handling
- **Data-driven greetings**: Use real data (dates, facts, statistics)

### 🚫 What NOT to Add
- ❌ Simple `print("Hello World")` - be creative!
- ❌ Duplicate existing greeting styles
- ❌ No context or explanation
- ❌ Basic string concatenation only

### ✅ Quality Guidelines
- **Add docstrings**: Explain what your function does
- **Include examples**: Show what the output looks like
- **Be creative**: Make it unique and interesting
- **Test your code**: Run it to make sure it works
- **Add comments**: Help others understand your thinking

### 🎭 Creative Examples (Good vs Bad)

**❌ Bad Example:**
```python
def hello_basic():
    return "Hello World"  # Too simple!
```

**✅ Good Example:**
```python
def hello_bangla_poem():
    """A mini Bengali poem greeting"""
    poem = '''
    ওহে বিশ্ব, আমার প্রিয় বন্ধু
    তোমার মাঝে আমার হৃদয় ভালবাসা বাঁধু
    '''
    return poem + "\n🌸 From Bangladesh with love!"
```

## 🎯 Contribution Guidelines

### ✅ What We Accept
- **Any creative idea** that adds chaos or fun
- **Bug fixes** (even if they create new bugs)
- **Performance improvements** (as long as they don't reduce chaos)
- **New features** that maintain the chaotic spirit

### ❌ What We Don't Accept
- **Boring code** (standard Hello World is too mainstream)
- **Breaking changes** without discussion
- **Removing existing chaos** (unless replacing with better chaos)

## 🔧 Development Setup

### Requirements
- Python 3.6+
