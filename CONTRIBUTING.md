- **Themed outputs** (holiday editions, pop culture references)

### 📊 Data & Analytics
- **Chaos tracking** (log how chaotic each run is)
- **User behavior analysis** (what makes people run it multiple times?)
- **Performance benchmarking** (how fast can chaos be?)

### 🎭 Creative Contributions
- **ASCII art** for the main.py
- **Sound effects** using simple audio libraries
